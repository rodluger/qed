\section*{Defining variables}

We can define a variable for use later in the document by using the
equivalence ($\equiv$) symbol inside an equation:
%
\begin{qed}
    x \equiv \sqrt{16}
\end{qed}
%
Note the icon next to the equation; \textsf{qed} did not perform
any tests but instead stored the expression for $x$.
%
We can then reference $x$ in subsequent equations, and \textsf{qed}
will recognize it and automatically substitute its definition:
%
\begin{qed}
    x = 4
\end{qed}
%
For convenience, users can also use the starred version of the
equivalence commmand (\verb!\equiv*!), which behaves in the same
way but typesets as a regular equality symbol:
%
%
\begin{qed}
    y \equiv* \sqrt{25}
\end{qed}
%
This works just as before:
%
\begin{qed}
    y = 5
\end{qed}
%
%
